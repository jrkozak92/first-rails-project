# My First Ruby on Rails App
 I've never used Ruby on Rails before this.<br/>
 I learned Ruby through Codecademy's Ruby course.<br/>
 I learned Rails by following the Ruby on Rails Guide for Getting Started with Rails<br/>
 <br/>
 This (when it's done) should be exactly as functional as that example (found here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
 <br/><br/>
 I'm really only hosting it here for posterity, and to keep my GitHub use record up.
